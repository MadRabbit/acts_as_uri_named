ActsAsUriNamed
==============

This plugin does the wrong thing we all do. It makes your model uri-name
field work as the primary key when you need it. Say for articles, blog
entries and so ones.


Example
=======

class Article < ActiveRecod::Base
  acts_as_uri_named
end

@article = Article.new :uri_name => 'bla-bla-bla'

article_path @article -> '/articles/bla-bla-bla'

Article.find('bla-bla-bla') will return the @article.

The original functionality is still available
Article.find(@article.id) will return the @article

If you have a nested units, with your model you can search by the full path
like

@article1 = Article.create :uri_name => 'bla'
@article2 = Article.create :uri_name => 'asdf', :parent => @article1

Article.find_by_full_uri_name('/bla/asdf') will return @article2
